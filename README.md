1. I would put my automated tests in the Github aciton that runs whenever code is pushed as it maintains a consistent format for everything pushed and you get feedback on your code instantly and prevents anybody from pushing incorrect code to the main branch.
2. I would not use an end to end test just for a single function as an E2E test as the test would be more focused on the entire application to see if everything works together correctly.
3. The snapshot mode takes a picture of of the current DOM without reloading the papge and is helpful for finding accessibility issues while navigation mode loads the full page and runs audits from initial load to its fully loaded state.
4. 3 things to improve is 1. make sure to properly size images, 2. save images in formats like WebP as its better than PNG/JPEg, and 3. adding preconnect resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins
